    abstract = "Homonymy is often used to showcase one of the advantages of context-sensitive word embedding techniques such as ELMo and BERT. In this paper we want to shift the focus to the related but less exhaustively explored phenomenon of polysemy, where a word expresses various distinct but related senses in different contexts. Specifically, we aim to i) investigate a recent model of polyseme sense clustering proposed by Ortega-Andres {\&} Vicente (2019) through analysing empirical evidence of word sense grouping in human similarity judgements, ii) extend the evaluation of context-sensitive word embedding systems by examining whether they encode differences in word sense similarity and iii) compare the word sense similarities of both methods to assess their correlation and gain some intuition as to how well contextualised word embeddings could be used as surrogate word sense similarity judgements in linguistic experiments.",
